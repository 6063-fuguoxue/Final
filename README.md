# Final Project
## Milestone 1: Project Ideas

This week, I generated 3 ideas for my final project development. 

### Idea 1: Friendly Printer
The inspiration for this project comes from two memes I found online: 

| Meme 1      | Meme 2 |
| ----------- | ----------- |

| The flower says "Please be friends with me. "   | The flower says "Please chat with me. "        |

I somehow resonate with the flowers in the memes. I always want to make new friends and chat with people, but I can be very introvert sometimes and don't know how to start a conversation. Therefore, I am wondering if a machine can act as a medium to have a conversation with even a stranger I've never met before. Below is my ideation of the project.

I plan to use a receipt printer because the machine and the receipt paper are relatively cheap and easy to buy. The process of receipt printing is also interesting to watch.

During the conversation, the printer appears very talkative, while the player can only choose from two responses: positive or negative. This is also an interesting reversal between human and machine, as human usually has more flexible and complex language system than machine.

Upon each response, the corresponding area on the screen will grow in size. However, the two colors get more and more similar to each other. 

When the screen is purely in one color, the machine will say goodbye to the player and tell the player: "You are the No. XX friend I made today. Thank you so much for accompanying me. Have a nice day..."

Players can tear the receipt away at the end of a conversation.  

### Idea 2: Rhythm at Fingertips

This project is inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BboivOblV-A). Below is a sketch of my idea.

The project invites people to create music by making their fingertips touch. A webcam will track hands within the camera range. While the music is being generated, an LED matrix will blink to visualize the music. 

The logic of this project should be simple and I've done similar things in my previous project. I think the main challenge would be how to make the music visualization attractive and replayable. 

### Idea 3: Weather Board

As the weather is getting cold in New York and the temperature difference within a day can be up to 10 celsius degrees, I always need to check on my phone so I know what to wear before going out. Therefore, I want to make a real-time weather data visualization interface, which lights up and shows weather information when I get close to it.

The interface will be able to recognize my gesture of swiping left or right to show me the past or future temperature. The Weather APP on iPhones can be a good reference for what information to include in my Weather Board.
